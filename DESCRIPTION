Title: Alpha Hull Computation
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Stéphane Laurent
Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Computation of the alpha hull of a set of points in the 3D
    space, that is to say "something like the shape formed by these
    points". The alpha hull depends on a positive parameter alpha. When
    alpha goes to zero, the alpha hull degenerates to the set of points,
    while it is the convex hull of the set of points when alpha goes to
    infinity.
